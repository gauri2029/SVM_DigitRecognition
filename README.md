# SVM_DigitRecognition
MNIST Digit Recognition using SVM Algorithm.
The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's Database which contain binary images of handwritten digits from 0-9. The train dataset contains 60,000 whereas the test dataset contains 10,000 samples.
## STEPS:
1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Import MNIST dataset using pandas library.
3. Exploratory analysis.
4. Visualizing data- pixels and labels.
5. Data pre-processing.
6. Train and Test data split.
7. Implementing the SVM linear algorithm.
8. Finding Accuracy.
## Accuracy of the model: 92%
